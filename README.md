# PROTECT Ireland

## Overview

### Purpose
The goal of PREVENT Ireland is to create an informative webpage that introduces the general public to the Prevent strategy and its education goals regarding radicalization. To facilitate this, the site's content should be well-organised and easy to digest, with a focus on simplicity and clarity. When visiting the site, they should know:
- What is Prevent
- What is radicalization and how to recognise it, and
- How to report it to the appropriate authorities and/or community partners

### Target Audience
This site should be useable by anyone seeking general information on the topic.

## Design Goals

These were the target goals for the website, starting with the minimal viable product (MVP) and expanding from there.

### Must-Have Design Elements
- As a site owner, I want clear and concise layout so information on Prevent is easily accessible.
- As a user, I want a clear and concise homepage with a simple layout to help me find the information I need.
- As a user I want to be reassured that the site is professional and provides accurate information.

### Should-Have Design Elements
- As a site owner, I want to display basic information on Prevent clearly and easily. 
- As a site owner, I want a responsive page allowing clear reading of information. 
- As a user I want to be able to find the information quickly and easily, regardless of device used to access the site.
- As a user I want a page that can direct me to find more information about Prevent’s initiatives.
- As a user, I want to easily reach out to someone for help.

### Could-Have Design Elements
- As a user, I want to know how to voice a complaint about Prevent.
- As a site owner, I want to redirect any complex queries to the relevant bodies.


## Design Decisions

When designing the site, I wanted to start with the follow: 

- Keep the design simple and clean.
- Make the site's content easy to digest.
- Reference the Irish flag colours.  
- Include an appropriate celtic themed logo.

### Colour Palette

I started with the official colour shades of the Irish Flag, with the intent of styling the primary layout and universal look of the site. Using [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) I then generated additional colours, and settled for a blue shade and a charcoal shade.

The final version of the site, I opted not to use the blue and charcoal colours, as these did not compliment the design as I had hoped. Instead, I opted to use a darker shade of green (#004e22) for the footer to offset the flag-green shade of the header, and a offwhite/cream colour (#fafafa) for the navigation menu and footer icons.

### Logo

The Celtic knot is uniquely Irish, and I wanted to find a design that would incorporate this imagery in the shape of a heart. The heart represents community, and the knotwork represents how everyone is connected together.

After a brief search, I found a free vector design I liked by Brian Goff on [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/). This was used for both the logo and favicon.

### Wireframes

Starting with a clear front page with a hero image, I wanted to make sure the layout was clear and easy to follow.

![risks_html](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f2b7429-3c93-43c6-82c4-9cc5b0dea8a3)
![community_html](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3d7c6e1-7593-457e-8f65-c28ade2de6c5)
![contact_html](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c9aea5d-068a-47de-b247-2c0ed3fe0880)

When breaking down the above wireframes, I realised I had gone out of scope - I was making too many pages and making the project too complicated for myself. I took a step back, and changed the buttons, and merged together 'What is Radicalization' and 'Community Resources' together, and designed a page that could include a layout for both.

### Accessibility Considerations
Discuss how accessibility guidelines were adhered to, including colour contrast and alt text for images.  
**Guidance:** Outline how you've incorporated accessibility into your design, ensuring that your project adheres to guidelines such as WCAG.



## Features Implementation

### Core Features (Must-Haves)
- **Feature 1:** Description of the implemented feature.
- **Feature 2:** Description of the implemented feature.

(Include all must-have features)  
**Guidance:** Use this section as you complete Phase 2: Must User Stories Implementation & Testing. Document all the must-have features you implemented, explaining how they align with the user stories and acceptance criteria.

### Advanced Features (Should-Haves)

(Include all should-have features)  
**Guidance:** Include any advanced features you implemented during Phase 3: Should User Stories Implementation & Any Advanced Features. Explain how these features enhance user experience and their alignment with the acceptance criteria.

### Optional Features (Could-Haves)


(Include any could-have features that were implemented or considered)  

## Testing and Validation

### Testing Results

I tested my website in Firefox, Chrome and Edge on PC, and Safari on IOS 17.6.1 on iPhone 13.

During this testing, I was able to:
- Identify colour and position padding issues with the menu, which I then corrected. 
- see that the embedded YouTube iframes were not responsive on the About and WhatIs pages. After adding appropriate CSS, this issue was corrected.   

### Validation

Due to time constraints with the project, I failed to allocate enough time to test the site using WC3's HTML and CSS checkers.

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. 

The deployment page can be found here: https://summonerskies.github.io/Prevent-Ireland/

## Reflection on Development Process

### Successes
I successfully created a page and a general look that is quite nice, and laid out the goals of the site clearly.

### Challenges
- I overscoped myself, and could have kept things much more simple. 
- I did not achieve all the goals of providing information.
- I did not leave myself enough time to do aappropriate WGAC check.
- I did not budget my time well, and spent too long on wireframing and looking for information. 

I learned a lot about timekeeping and prioritization from this project.

### Final Thoughts
Provide any additional insights gained during the project and thoughts on the overall process.  
**Guidance:** Begin drafting reflections during Phase 1 and update throughout the project. Finalize this section after Phase 4. Highlight successes and challenges, particularly regarding the use of AI tools, and provide overall insights into the project.
